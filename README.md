Accessible Power Apps and Solutions

Here's my collection of Power Apps, Power Automate Flows, and other bits that feed into building Accessiblity into Power Platform Solutions

WCAGandAccessibleThemeBuilder_1_0_0_0 is the first release of my WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) Theme Solution for Power Apps. Installation of the solution is done by importing the solution into a Power Apps environment with Dataverse and Power Automate.

NOTE: To install this solution you will first need to download and install the PCF control by Eswar Prakash. The version I used is at https://github.com/eswarpr/pcfgallery-submissions/releases/download/0.1.6/PCFPowerControls.zip but be sure to stay tuned to his GitHub repository at https://github.com/eswarpr
